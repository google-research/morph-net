def get_network_fn(name, num_classes, weight_decay=0.0, is_training=False):
  """Returns a network_fn such as `logits, end_points = network_fn(images)`.

  Args:
    name: The name of the network.
    num_classes: The number of classes to use for classification. If 0 or None,
      the logits layer is omitted and its input features are returned instead.
    weight_decay: The l2 coefficient for the model weights.
    is_training: `True` if the model is being used for training and `False`
      otherwise.

  Returns:
    network_fn: A function that applies the model to a batch of images. It has
      the following signature:
          net, end_points = network_fn(images)
      The `images` input is a tensor of shape [batch_size, height, width, 3]
      with height = width = network_fn.default_image_size. (The permissibility
      and treatment of other sizes depends on the network_fn.)
      The returned `end_points` are a dictionary of intermediate activations.
      The returned `net` is the topmost layer, depending on `num_classes`:
      If `num_classes` was a non-zero integer, `net` is a logits tensor
      of shape [batch_size, num_classes].
      If `num_classes` was 0 or `None`, `net` is a tensor with the input
      to the logits layer of shape [batch_size, 1, 1, num_features] or
      [batch_size, num_features]. Dropout has not been applied to this
      (even if the network's original classification does); it remains for
      the caller to do this or not.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If network `name` is not recognized.
